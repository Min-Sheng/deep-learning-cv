First things first, 50% isn't bad for a simple CNN.  Pure guessing would get you 10% accuracy. However, you might notice people are getting scores [well above 80%](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html#43494641522d3130).  That's because we haven't taught you all there is to know about neural networks.
